We are going to learn How to build your own Full Stack deepseek AI app using Next JS. In this Full Stack Next js project we will use Clerk for user authentication and MongoDB Atlas for Database. When user creates account on this deepseek clone app, then user data will be stored in MongoDB database with the help of clerk webhooks. 

When you ask anything  from AI, you will get the response using DeepSeek API, and all chat data will get saved in the database that you can access from the sidebar of this AI App.

After building this next.js project we will deploy it online using Vercel and we will get the project live link. You can use that project live link in your resume.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
